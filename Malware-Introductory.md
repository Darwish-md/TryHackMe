#### When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:
- Point of Entry (PoE): I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment?
- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- Can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

#### Attacks can generally be classified into two types: Targeted and Mass Campaign.
##### Targeted: 
- Example of this type of purpose could be the ***DarkHotel*** and ***Stuxnet*** (Targeted Iran).
##### Mass Campaign: 
- The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may.
- Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns and report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from WHO.

### Identifying Malware Attack
Malware (dependant on its variant) is largely obtrusive - in the sense that it leaves quite an extensive papertrail of evidence.
