#### When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:
- Point of Entry (PoE): I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment?
- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- Can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

#### Attacks can generally be classified into two types: Targeted and Mass Campaign.
##### Targeted: 
- Example of this type of purpose could be the ***DarkHotel*** and ***Stuxnet*** (Targeted Iran).
##### Mass Campaign: 
- The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may.
- Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns and report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from WHO.

### Identifying Malware Attack
Malware (dependant on its variant) is largely obtrusive - in the sense that it leaves quite an extensive papertrail of evidence.

##### The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:
1. Delivery (EX: PDF, or a USB)
2. Execution (EX: if it encrypts files => Ransomware, if it records keystrokes => Spyware)
3. Maintaining persistence (not always the case!)
4. Propagation (not always!) (If you can infect one device, why not infect more)

##### Two categories of fingerprints malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:
- Host based signature 
- Network based signature (EX: in Ransomware, where has the Malware contacted for Bitcoin payments?)

### Static vs Dynamic analysis
#### Static:
- At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code. 
- EX: Signature analysis via checksums or checking the code.
#### Dynamic:
- It essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens.

### Obfuscation/Packing
- Packing is one form of obfuscation that malware Authors employ to prevent decompiling and then analysis of programmes.
- A legitimate reason is the protection of intellectual property!
- Malware Authors employ obfuscation techniques such as packing to prevent us reversing it to understand its behaviours.
- we can use `PEiD` to identify the packer/compiler, while `IDA Freeware` is a disassembler tool used for reverse engineering and analyzing binary files by examining the assembly code.

### Disassemblers/Debuggers
- Disassemblers reverse the compiled code of a program from machine code to human-readable instructions (assembly). This is limited to how the program represents itself in its current state! I.e. If the contents of an executable changes during execution - "Disassemblers" will not reflect this.
- Debuggers facilitate execution of the program - where the analyser can view the changes made throughout each "step" of the program.
