### Creeper
- The Creeper Program, also known as the "Creeper worm" or "virus", was the first-ever virus to be created. Written by Bob Thomas in 1971, the program used ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to transfer itself between computers.
- Creeper was designed to self-replicate by copying its code onto other systems connected to the ARPANET. 
- Creeper did not cause any significant damage or data loss, as it was more of a proof-of-concept experiment than a malicious attack.

### Reaper
- According to malware.wiki Reaper is called a nematode, which is a type of malware which removes other malware but Reaper was actually the first anti-virus software produced

### Wabbit
- The Wabbit (Rabbit) virus was written in 1974.
- The malware was only able to infect the machine it was put on and did not pass via a network, hence why it is not classed as a worm which makes it a form of denial-of-service known as a "fork bomb".
- Rabbit works by creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file, creating a high number of CPU cycles which "constipates" the system and consumes operating system resources.

### ANIMAL
- In 1975 the first Trojan was written. ANIMAL, created by John Walker, would act as a game and ask the user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thinking of. Whilst the user played the "fun" game, another subroutine, called "PERVADE" would create a copy of itself and ANIMAL in every directory that the user has access to.
- John thought this was a good idea as ANIMAL would eventually be run by a privileged user and "it would copy itself into the system library, thus making it available to all users".

### Elk Cloner
- The malware worked by attaching itself to the Apple II operating systems and spread via floppy disk. It was written in 1982 originally as a practical joke to mess with his friends.
- The technique that Elk Cloner used is a technique now called "boot sector virus". The program was placed into a game's code until an unsuspecting victim started the game for the 50th time. This then activated the virus. Instead of launching the game, it would change to a blank screen that displayed a poem about the virus.

### Morris Internet Worm
-  The Morris Internet Worm was released in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris.
-  It was supposed to highlight security flaws of the academic networks that it travelled to. This worked... but not how he expected. The only downfall of the worm was that it failed to check which computers it had already been to, thus infecting many computers multiple times and causing a denial of service attack.
-  Morris was the first person to be arrested from a felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse act.

### Cascade
- Cascade was notably the first type of malware to use a form of encryption. This encryption was not used to directly harm the user's data, but rather to keep the program undetected.
- The virus infected files with extension ".COM" which were similar to batch and .sh files. When the infected file is executed or opened, the virus activates and begins its malicious activities (like falling text).
