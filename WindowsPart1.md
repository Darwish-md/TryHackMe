## Concepts
- the file system used in modern versions of Windows is the New Technology File System or simply NTFS.
- To access the users and groups on the machine, we search for `lusrmgr.msc` short for Local User and Group Management from Run search dialogue.
- How does UAC (User Account Control) work? When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run.
